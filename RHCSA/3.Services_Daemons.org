# Daemons

It is a system generated procewss which will be running in the background from boot.

# RHEL6

## Service Manager -> init
    + Its the parent process of all other processes.
    + Its UID is 1

ps -> Its a command that lists current running processes

## Runlevels

+ init 0 -> Shutdown
+ init 1 -> Rescue mode, single user, no net access
+ init 2 -> Multiuser , no net connection
+ init 3 -> Multiuser , with net access
+ init 4 -> No use
+ init 5 -> Graphical
+ init 6 -> Reboot

- who -r -> Its a command that will show the current init runlevel.

+ Command to start a unit.
    service (unit name) start

+ Command to enable a service
    chconfig (unit name) on

# RHEL7

• The Service Manger is called “systemd”
• Its the parent process of all procewsses
• It has UID 1

##Systemctl

It is a object that calls systemd

This was made as in init’s case we allwas disturbed the parent processes whenever we wanted to a dd as service or cahnge runlevel. This was seen as being inefficient. So the concept of systemctl in systemd was formed.

*COMMAND*
• systemctl start (unitname)      → Starts a service
• systemctl stop (unitname)       → Stops a service
• systemctl enable (unitname)     → Enable a service so it will start on boottime
• systemctl disablw (unitname)    → This disables a service
• systemctl is-enabled (unitname) → Tell whether the service is enabled or not
• systemctl is-active (unitname)  → Will tell us if the service is active or not
• systemctl list-units            → Will list all the avalible units
• systemctl list-unit-files       → Will list all the paths of all the units
• systemctl mask (unitname)       → It will mask the unit

• Note
   ◦ A masked unit is one where we dont have the privilage to delete it.

## Runlevels

From RHEL7 runlevels have n=been called targets.
•rescue.target
•multiuser.target
•poweroff.target
•graphical.target
•reboot.target

The command is:
• systemctl isolate (targe name) → To run hat target only once.
• systemctl get-default          → This will print the default runlevel
• systemctl set-default (target name)   → This will set to the mentioned target.

→ We also need to know how to add kernel parametes in the boot sequence when we do not have a terminal at our disposal.
