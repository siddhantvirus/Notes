* 3 ways to configure repository
** Online repository(rpm,yum)
** Configuring repository through network(using http, ftp)
   "/etc/yum.repos.d/" - This is the default location of the configs for the yum repository.
*** Sample repo

    [123] ##This is the repository Id
    name = xyz.repo
    baseurl = http://clasroom.edxample.com/content/rhel7.0/x86_64/ded
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0  ## This is so that it will ask for the subscription id

** Configuring repository locally in your machine
   To configure repos localy we need an .ios file of redhat.
*** Steps
    1. We extract the iso.
       This is done by mounting the .iso to generally /mnt directory.
    2. All the packages are avalible in "/mnt/Packages"
    3.  
**** Sample yum.repos.d repos file
     [123]
     name=xyz.repos
     baseurl=file:///mnt
     enable=1
     gpgcheck=0
